    "## What is a signal\n",
    "In neuroscience, most signals are **voltage varying in time**. Many bio-signals are amplified and filtered electric potentials (ie. voltages), such as ECG, EEG, EMG, etc. Others might be the result of a transducer, a device converting different physical measurements (eg. distance, pressure) to (usually) voltage.\n",
    "A notable exception are all video based signals, such as eye tracking. These are usually recorded as some arbitrary units directly in digital form.\n",
    "### Analog to Digital\n",
    "Most signals are measured as analog signals. This means they are continuous over time. Computers can't store or even process analog signals, we therefore use an *analog to digital converter* (ADC) which does what it says on the tin. This step is called **discretization**. From here on, continuous and analog as well as discrete and digital are going to be used interchangeably.\n",
    "Here is an example of a pure sine wave discretized at different sampling rates."

    "These plots show us that there is a qualitative change in the interpolated signal when the sampling rate drops below 6 Hz. While at 6 Hz the signal still looks more or less like the original (well, kinda), at 5.8 the interpolated signal suddenly is in antiphase. Even lower, completely new signals with much lower frequency appear. Notably, at 3 Hz (the fundamental frequency of the original signal) the signal completely flattens out to a DC (Direct Current) Signal. This makes sense, since each time we take a sample, the signal will be at exactly the same amplitude.\n",

    "## The Nyquist-Shanon Theorem\n",
    "These effects are called aliasing and are caused by a sampling rate that does not comply with the *Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon* theroem. There were multiple, independent, discoveries of this theorem. It is most commonly known as the *Nyquist* or the *Nyquist-Shannon* Theorem. \n",

    ">If a function x(t) contains no frequencies higher than B Hertz, it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced 1/(2B) seconds apart\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a signal is completely determined (ie. there is no information lost) if the sampling rate is more than twice as high as the highest frequency component present in the signal. This frequency of *2B* is called the Nyquist rate (or frequency). In the example it is 6Hz since the highest frequency (and only) component is at 3 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "A look at the plots shows that there are some issues: frequencies complying  with the theorem but close to the Nyquist rate are still quite distorted. We use the best possible interpolation method: the sinc interpolation (named after the sinc function described above). But we have only sampled over a limited time window. Would we extend it to $\\pm \\infty$ we should be able to reconstruct the signal perfectly. In theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of these sampling theorems is not just to avoid losing information. \n",
    "At 6 and 3 Hz the signal flatlines, this is due to the sampling rate being at or at twice, the frequency of the signal. In this case, we sampled every time the signal passed through 0. So ignoring the theorem can lead to completely asinine  results.\n",
