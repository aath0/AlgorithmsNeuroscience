    "# Complex Numbers\n",
    "Why are we talking about complex numbers? The explanations go beyond the scope of this introduction, but the short version is that in engineering, a sinusoidal signal with time-invariant amplitude (A), angular frequency ($\\omega$) and initial phase ($\\varphi$) can be represented by a complex number called a phasor (short for phase vector). \n",
    "\n",
    "A quick and not quite exact explanation of these terms\n",
    "- amplitude (A): the distance from the signals mid value to its maxima.\n",
    "- angular frequency ($\\omega$): ' to frequency, but indicating how quickly the signal goes through it's cycle. It is straightforward to compute from the frequency: $\\omega = 2 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot f$. If you remember your high school math, $2\\pi$ in radians is a complete revolution (ie. $360^\\circ$).\n",
    "- frequency (f): how often the signals oscillates around its mid value.\n",
    "- phase ($\\varphi$): the delay in relation to an arbitrary point in the cycle of the signal, usually the starting point of another signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same signal can be represented as:\n",
    "- $x(t) = A \\cdot \\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)$\n",
    "- $x(t) = A \\cdot e^{\\imath(\\omega t + \\varphi)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are equivalent. If you want to check this, use Euler's formula. A phasor is written without reference to time change, but only with reference to another signal, hence it is usually written as $A\\cdot e^{\\imath\\cdot\\varphi}$ or $A\\angle\\varphi$."

    "There are two ways to represent complex number:\n",
    "- *rectangular* or *cartesian*: decomposes the number into it's real and imaginary part and is written as $z = re + \\imath \\cdot im$ where $re$ and $im$ are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of the number.\n",
    "- *polar*: the number is represented as $magnitude \\cdot e^{\\imath\\cdot argument}$ where the magnitude (r) (or modulus) is the distance from the origin (O) to the point and the argument describes the angle between the line going from the origin to z and the positive real axis.\n",
    "Maybe you noticed that the polar representation uses a very similar representation as the phasor above. This is not a coincidence, $\\varphi$ represents a delay in the cycle, so it is the same as the phase of our phasor. The magnitude represents the maximal value that can be projected on the real (or imaginary) axis and is the same as the amplitude of the phasor.\n",

    "## What is a signal\n",
    "In neuroscience, most signals are **voltage varying in time**. Many bio-signals are amplified and filtered electric potentials (ie. voltages), such as ECG, EEG, EMG, etc. Others might be the result of a transducer, a device converting different physical measurements (eg. distance, pressure) to (usually) voltage.\n",

Computers can't store or even process analog signals, we therefore use an *analog to digital converter* (ADC) which does what it says on the tin. This step is called **discretization**. From here on, continuous and analog as well as discrete and digital are going to be used interchangeably.\n",

While at 6 Hz the signal still looks more or less like the original (well, kinda), at 5.8 the interpolated signal suddenly is in antiphase. Even lower, completely new signals with much lower frequency appear. Notably, at 3 Hz (the fundamental frequency of the original signal) the signal completely flattens out to a DC (Direct Current) Signal. This makes sense, since each time we take a sample, the signal will be at exactly the same amplitude.\n",

This frequency of *2B* is called the Nyquist rate (or frequency). In the example it is 6Hz since the highest frequency (and only) component is at 3 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "A look at the plots shows that there are some issues: frequencies complying  with the theorem but close to the Nyquist rate are still quite distorted. We use the best possible interpolation method: the sinc interpolation (named after the sinc function described above). But we have only sampled over a limited time window. Would we extend it to $\\pm \\infty$ we should be able to reconstruct the signal perfectly. In theory.\n",
