Nothing in this should be above college mathematics and physics, so if you feel confident you rember it, feel free to skip.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#Complex-Numbers">Complex numbers</a> are fairly essential to understanding how sinusoids are represented in signal processing (and electronics in general). They are also a big help for visualising amplitude and phase of a signal.</li>
<li><a href="#Temporal-Vs.-Spectral-Space">Temporal Vs. Spectral Space</a> will cover some concepts important to understanding what an electronic signal is and how to decompose it into it's components. The focus will lay on the Fourier series and transforms.</li>
<li><a href="#Acquiring-Data">Acquiring Data</a> will cover some of the basic concepts of data acquisition, such as the Nyquist-Shanon Theorem</li>
