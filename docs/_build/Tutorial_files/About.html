My research interests include macnine learning, deep learning and their applications in neuroscience.</p>
<h3 id="Athina-Tzovara">Athina Tzovara<a class="anchor-link" href="#Athina-Tzovara"> </a></h3><p>My research uses computational techniques to study human cognition. During my PhD, I developed machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of coma patients based on their neural responses to sounds (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148350">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148350</a>). Moreover, I have been using machine learning and computational modeling techniques to model physiological data, in relation to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912001632?via%3Dihub">decision-making</a>, or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006243">associative learning</a>. Importantly, throughout my research, I am advocating open and inclusive science practices, promoting diversity and inclusivity.</p>
